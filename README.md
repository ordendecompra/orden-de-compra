## Antes de crear una nueva 'issue'

* **Este sitio es sólamente para issues de ordendecompra.cl.**

* Busque la issue [aquí](https://github.com/ordendecompra/orden-de-compra/search?q=&type=Issues) para verificar si ya fue reportada. Puede usar etiquetas para filtrar la [lista de issues](https://github.com/ordendecompra/orden-de-compra/issues) al hacer click en cualquiera de las relacionadas con el problema que quiere reportar o buscar.

## Filing a bug

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the problem.
*   Write a **summary** of the problem in a few lines, giving an idea of what the issue is about.
*   Then, **describe** the bug with all the information you can give.
    Be sure to include the following information:
    * Operating System
    * The version of Sublime Text that you're using
    * Any related software which may cause ST to act strangely
    * If relevant, does the bug occur with no packages installed / [with ST3 in a reverted/clean state](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/revert.html)?

    Also keep in mind to clearly separate fact from speculation.
*   Try to find a way to **reproduce** the problem and write down precise steps. It might be useful to include a *code example* for this.
*   Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome.

We won't slaughter you if you can't fulfill all of these steps, but prepare to answer a few questions if we think we're lacking information.

If you want to be really good at reporting bugs, you can also read [these guidelines](https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-5.0-branch/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html) for bugzilla bugs.

## Filing an enhancement or a feature request

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the issue.
*   Explain briefly what the enhancement is and why you think it would be useful.
*   Provide any other necessary or useful information regarding your issue, such as (code) examples or related links.

Note: "enhancements" are modifications to existing behavior as opposed to something entirely new.
